<h1>Autocompleter for TeXworks</h1>

<p>
TeXworks is my favourite LaTeX editor, partly because it is multi 
platform and partly because it can be extended with scripts.
The built in autocompleter is template based and is not aware of 
the content in the open files.
As an attempt of improving the autocompleting of texworks the 
following script was created.
The script suggests completions based on content in the opened 
files and a builtin list of templates.
</p>

<p>
Below a video demonstration is shown of script in action. 
All activations of the script in this video is through the same 
shortcut "crtl + m".

<p>
The script is available on 
<a href="https://github.com/henrikmidtiby/TeXworks-scripts/tree/master/autocomplete">github</a> and the behaviour 
of the script and its implementation is described in 
the documentation, which can be downloaded 
<a href="../downloads/autocomplete.pdf">here</a>.
